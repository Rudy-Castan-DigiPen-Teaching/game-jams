# Describe how the game reflects the theme #
Our game RE:Digipen reflects the theme 'Start Small' by the increase of stats. 
There are basically two stats where you need to score high in order to achieve the goal of the game, while on the other hand, there are also two stats where you have to manage so that you do not trip down from this long race. Although our protagonist starts from a small jump, he furthermore become a better person in many areas thanks to those small movements. While there isn't such visual appearance of starting small, it still represents the theme thoroughly.
